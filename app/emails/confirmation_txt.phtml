Hi, <?= $user->first_name; ?>.

You have recently requested an account at the <?= $site_name; ?> website.
You now need to confirm this using your extra special confirmation token, which is:

<?= $user->verification_string; ?>
In fact, you can just go here: 
    http://<?= $host . $REL_PATH; ?>user/confirm/<?= $user->id; ?>/<?= $user->verification_string; ?>
to confirm <em>automagically!</em>

Thanks!
