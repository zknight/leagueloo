<h1 class="title"><?= SiteName(); ?> Reschedule Request</h1>
<p><strong>Before you request a reschedule, please read and consent to the following:</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> You may only request a reschedule using this tool for:
<ul>
    <li>All South Lakes Soccer Club in-house recreational matches (U5-U11)<li>
    <li>FCSA Traveling Recreational matches (U12-U18) <strong>played at South Lakes Soccer Club Complex</strong></li>
    <li>FCSA Competitive matches (U11-U18) <strong>played at South Lakes Soccer Club Complex</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>You must have contact the opposing coach prior to proceding with a reschedule request.</em></p>
<p>
The Referee Assignor's job is to make sure that USSF registered referees are assigned to 
all games played in the Club. To do this, referees must be contacted days ahead of time 
in order to ensure their availability.  For this reason, last minute rescheduling of games 
causes considerable problems.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, <strong>rescheduling of games should only be done if absolutely necessary, as in the 
case of a coach or coaches being out of town, or a team going to a tournament.</strong>
</p>
<br />
<h3 style="text-align:center;">RESCHEDULING OF GAMES</h3>
<p>
Any coach who wishes to reschedule a Club game must first call the other coach to obtain agreement 
for rescheduling.  Once agreement is obtained, the following steps must be followed:
</p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The original game must be canceled by the coach initiating the reschedule by 
            requesting a reschedule no later than <strong>10:00 p.m. on the Sunday</strong> prior to the game 
            (U12 and older) or <strong>Tuesday at 10:00 p.m.</strong>  for U5 through U10.
        </li>
        <li>
            The initiating coach is responsible for coordinating with 
            the opposing coach to select a first and second choice date and time for the 
            rescheduled game.
        </li>
    </ol>
<p><strong>Please note that a game may not be canceled:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        After 10:00 p.m. on the Sunday night prior to a game.
    </li>
    <li>
        Without notification of and agreement from the opposing coach.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
If the above conditions are not met, teams who do not show up for their originally 
scheduled game will be listed on the referee's game report as "No Shows" and the 
referee(s) will be paid by the Club. The game may be played on another date only if 
additional referee fees are paid by the 2 teams.
</p>
