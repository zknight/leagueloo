paths
-----
/ - default (home) view
/:program - program view
/news/article/:action/:id
/news/article/:action/:id.<response type> default html, can be json or others as added

/<program> - program controller, look-up program by name (which should be index?)
program is special because it is not a resource but a landing (site?)

nested resources
----------------
since routing is done via module/controller, how to identify RESTful stuff?
Don't like Rails way of doing it because it is cumbersome.  How to make it
more straight-forward, less magical?

Nested resources belong to a parent.  Let parent controller handle it?

not 1:1 controller <-> model.  MVC doesn't have to be this way.  break this.

example: news/:id/article/[:id]
    route to 'news' controller
    method          action
    ------          ------
    GET             show_article(news_id, article_id)
    POST            new_article(parent_id)
    PUT             edit_article(parent_id, article_id)
    DELETE          delete_article(parent_id, article_id)

example: news/[:id]
    GET             show(news_id)
    POST            new()
    PUT             edit_news(news_id)
    DELETE          delete_news(news_id)

or, should control be delegated somehow ('partial' controller?)
Action is rendered as a subset...

controllers
-----------
Two kinds: REST, non-REST
BaseController is non-REST
    actions are indepdendent of resources

RESTController is REST
    has basic REST CRUD actions
    automatically maps args to REST actions

For nested resources, must 'register' sub-resources somehow
Multiple classes per module?

example:
    news/[:id] routes to NewsController
    news/:id/article/:id routes to ArticleController in context of news?

    what about 'nice' URLs?  Is this rest REST, wouldn't ever be used
    to Create/Update/Delete? 

    POST recreational/news/
    GET/PUT/DELETE recreational/news/camps_in_full_swing
    would lookup up camps_in_full_swing article under recreational news

    This makes the assumption that news<->program are 1:1
    How would this be routed?
    Not covered by automatice routing by directory because lookup is by
    something other than id and controller is not specified directly

    If it doesn't match dir based routing, have program controller delegate to
    another controller? 

    What about recreational/camps_in_full_swing/?

    program (main) controller is default, what does second thing mean?
    
    Program is not a resource, is it?


routing
-------
Routing by controller
    default controller checks route
        /bulletin/:id
        delegates to bulletin controller passing :id as bulletin_id

        /recreational/bulletin/:id
        no route matches, leftover is entire route
        program controller checks first element and treats it as 
        resource (program by name)
        then delegates to bulletin controller passing :id as bulletin_id
        and id of 'recreational' program
        bulletin controller checks remaining route /bulletin/:id
        should match bulletin 
        how to do by name?
        /recreational/bulletin/registration_is_open
        
        [recreational, bulletin, registration_is_open]
              |           |             |
              |           |             +- doesn't match /^\d+$/ or action
              |           +- route to bulletin controller
              +- doesn't match /^\d+$/ or action

For RESTController
1. check to see if matches controller
2. if not, check to see if matches action
3. if not, check to see if matches id
4. finally, check to see if matches resource
5. if not, 404

For BaseController
1. check to see if matches controller
1. if not, check to see if matches action in current controller
2. if not, 404

This is multi-level routing.

How to differentiate between something like this...
 /program/:id/bulletin/ (a)
 /team/:id/bulletin/ (b)

(a) shows all bulletins associated with program[:id]
(b) shows all bulletins associated with team[:id]

hmmmm.  For RESTController, delegate?

models
------
Use redbeanphp (fuse) to implement models

        
applets
-------
plug-ins (modules)
- have their own 'controller' and 'view'
